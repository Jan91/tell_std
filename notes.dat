Starting with P101 (April 2018), we will obtain only one set of telluric standard star observations with different slit widths each night X-shooter is used. Unless provided in concatenation with their science, we will not take additional tellurics throughout the night for any science observations.

Select 4 telluric standard stars of spectral type B5-9V for every month of the year from the stdsop-B-Stars_single.cat catalogue. Those have to cover morning and evening twilight with airmass around 1.3-1.4 and be south/north in case of wind restrictions.

Check the phase3 products of selected stars to ensure that they are indeed OK in terms of spectrum and flux (i.e., no strange features or emission lines, not too faint in the near-infrared, etc.). You can find overview plots here: http://qcweb.hq.eso.org/XSHOOT_TELL/monitor/FINISHED/2017/2017-09/2017-09.html Click auf „ABs“ fuer die taegliche Uebersicht (inkl. Plots) und auf ‚histo‘ (oben links) fuer monatliche oder jaehrliche Uebersicht. Waehrend das die prozess-orientierte Uebersicht ist, gibt es auch noch eine target-orientierte Uebersicht: http://qcweb.hq.eso.org/XSHOOT_TELL/plots/OVERVIEW/tell_overview.html

Login www.eso.org/p2 with 52022/uvetta and create a folder named "telluric_of_the_month" under PROG.ID 60.A-9022(C). In this folder, create SLT and IFU OBs (using the *cal* templates) for the selected stars with the same setup as now used for telluric standards stars. Naming convention of OBs: TELL_TargetName_month_{morning/evening}twilight. For each star, an OB with several templates has to be created that cover all slit widths (group similar slit widths together). The ETC should be used to calculate exposure times for average conditions (airmass 1.35, seeing 0.8"). The counts in the middle of the detector should be around 20000-30000 ADU. 

Some tests on sky should be performed to check that the exposure times are reasonable.
